# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

In general, exploratory testing presents a more broad perspective of software testing. It is not exhaustive, and its primary goal is to test the core functionalities that a system is built off of. It does not follow a script, but rather operates by users testing whatever comes to mind, as long as it is logical to do so. Conversely, manual functional testing is the strict following of a script in order to perform tests. This is where individual functions get tested repeatedly with varying inputs, and system states are explored in much more depth. Relative to the provided test suite, the given test cases were more specific than the exploratory tests, and involved putting oneself in situations that users would rarely encounter during a normal run of the program. For example, one of the test cases was “User enters correct pin on third try”, and another was “A deposit transaction can be canceled by the customer at any time prior to inserting an envelope”. These situations are more obscure, and did not occur to any group member during the exploratory test phase. Comparing these two testing methods, each one has advantages/disadvantages over the other. Exploratory testing is faster and overall less demanding, but manual functional testing is more thorough, complete and will likely find more bugs in the end. Manual functional testing tries to be exhaustive. Even though it can’t test every possible input, it spends a good amount of time on edge cases and values that users wouldn’t normally enter. Deciding which method of testing is better overall is subjective and varies on a case-to-case basis. In an agile team, where working software is demanded at a fast pace, exploratory testing may be sufficient as there is more emphasis on the core functionalities of the system. Additionally, in an environment where developers are receiving constant feedback, there will always be opportunity to fix bugs in the loop of sprint cycles. However, in a waterfall team, where customer feedback is not received until the end of the project, manual functional testing is required as it is essential that the final product is well-tested and as bug-free as it can be. As well, large scale projects that involve sensitive client information, such as a banking system should also be tested with manual functional testing. This is because bugs/exploits that are not patched may have a catastrophic effect, and customers will not feel secure using software that is not thoroughly tested. In our testing, we found that exploratory testing found more bugs, however, performing regression tests was easier on manual scripted tests since they were well-documented.
